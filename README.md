# Machine-learning-for-power-disturbance-and-cyber-attack-discriminations
This project aims to classify classify different system power disturbances as NoEvents, Attack or Natural disturbances using machine learning models such as random forest, logistic regression, and k-Nearest neighbor. And by evaluating their performance, the benchmark model will be exposed.
